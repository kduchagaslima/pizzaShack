# PizzaShack Project

PizzaShack is a full stack web application buillt with Node and Express that allows users to order pizza and receive a text message once they confirm their order. The interface allows users to select and adjust quantity to see their total order with all adjustments updating to the database in real time.

## Final Product
This is a project using Express.js. Using PostGres on the back end it stores users, orders, and items in the database for persistent state even if the server goes down. HTML and CSS are used in conjunction with EJS for the front end design. Passwords are encrypted with Bcrypt.
